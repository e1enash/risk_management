This	course	introduced me to effective	tools	of	managing	risks	faced	by	the	firm.	We	examined a	broad	range	of	risks:	from	financial	risks	measured	by	statistical	models	to	those	risks,	which	are	hard	to	quantify	but	are	nevertheless	very	important	for	the	firm.	The	course	structure	was	based	on	a	holistic	framework	of	the	enterprise-wide	risk	management	(ERM),	which	includes	identification,	evaluation,	treatment,	and	monitoring	of	risks. The core	of	the	course	is	the	measurement	of	market	and	credit	risk	using	Value	at	Risk	(VaR) and	other	metrics.	In	addition	to	that,	we	discuss	how	to	evaluate	operational,	political,	and	other	‘soft’	risks.
